# BunnyMazesGame
My small J2ME game application that is similar to the maze problem for Java mobiles
There were times when Java based mobiles were popular. Wanted to create a puzzle game that involves mazes,a bunny and a carrot.
A timed game with 10 levels having increasing complexity developed in J2ME.
Detailed documentation coming soon.
